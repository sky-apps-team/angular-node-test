I've beed told to do as much as possible in 1-hour, that meant no time for proper tests.


Few things to comment out:

* Started with the Backend to provide a simple way to authenticate users
* Built a simple Frontend to submit data

Personal note: 1 hour isn't much really to provide a good solution.

#Edit

I've been told to add extra 30 mins. I'll add some test to the backend.


# Setup

* cd angular-node-test
* npm install
* node server.js

# Tests

* mocha spec.js
